# UX

### Site Purpose

For people that seeks a friendly enviorment and share ideas from different sectors, also for people that aren't able to work from home.

### Site Goal

Give information to people how we work at Coworking and why u should be coworking.

### Audience

I would say from the student to the eldery who wants to get away from home and work with like minded people.

### Current User Goal

Contact us

### New User Goal

* Learn what coworking is.
* Learn to know the company Coworking.
* Start a subscription for our office.

## Communication

For communication ive focused on a simple website with light colours to give a clean experience, i choose to have a picture on every page with text that gives more experience for the user what coworking is and finish with a sign up form where you can start the subscription.


# Design

### Colour Palette

I choosed the color from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php) I choose to keep the website with 1 color as background to keep it nice and clean.

![colorpalette](/assets/images/color%20readme.png)

### Typography

I picked my font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) I've used Roboto for my website because of the clean text and easy to read.

### Images

All my images on the site comes from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/website/) I used pexels because its easy to find good pictures for free, also they had all the pictures i wanted to bring a feeling for the coworking enviroment on my website.

# Features

### Languages Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript - for the dropdown menu

### Navigation bar

The navigation bar is the same on all 3 pages with Home, About Us, Membership in a row. When you go under 800px it transform to a dropdown menu for the responsivnes on phones. I've added hover effect so it easy for the user to know where they are.

## Landing Page

When you arrive and the landing page you will have a background picture with a slogan and under it you get introduced to the benefits of coworking. The idea behind that is to make the customer excitied to continue the reading and explore the website.

## About Us

About us page starts like the homepage with a picture and a text so the user know that this page is about the company. Under the picture u will have sections where we write about our self and benefits from coworking.

problems, also its responsive in the diffrent phones in Devtools.
